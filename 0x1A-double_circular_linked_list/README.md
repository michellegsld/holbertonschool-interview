| 0-add_node.c | **Task: 0. Add Nodes** <br> A source file written in C that contains two functions. The first function has the prototype `List *add_node_end(List **list, char *str);`, in which a new node is added to the end of a double circular linked list. The `List` is the list to be modified, where `str` is the string to copy into the new node. The other function has the prototype `List *add_node_begin(List **list, char *str);`, in which a new node must be added to the beginning of a double circular linked list. Both functions return the address of the new node or `NULL` on failure. |
