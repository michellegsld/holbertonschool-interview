| 0-lockboxes.py | **Task: 0. Lockboxes** <br> A Python method to determine is all "boxes" in a 2D array can be opened. The prototype is `def canUnlockAll(boxes)` where `boxes` is a list of lists. The way this works is that a key with the same number as a box, opens that box, and all keys are positive integers. The first box is always unlocked and referenced as `boxes[0]` and returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, else it returns `False`. |
