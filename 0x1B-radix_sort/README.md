| 0-radix_sort.c | **Task: 0. Radix Sort** <br> A function written in C that sorts an array of integers in ascending order by using the `LSD` Radix sort algorithm. The prototype is `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);`, where the `array` is assumed to only contain numbers `>=0`. `malloc` and `free` are allowed to be used and the `array` is supposed to be printed everytime the `significant digit` is increased. |
