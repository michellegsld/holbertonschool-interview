| 0-find_loop.c | **Task: 0. Find the loop** <br> A function written in C that finds the loop in a linked list. The prototype is `listint_t *find_listint_loop(listint_t *head);`, which returns the address of the node where the loops starts or `NULL` if there is no loop. `malloc`, `free` and arrays weren't allowed to be used and only a maximum of two variables could be declared in the function. |
