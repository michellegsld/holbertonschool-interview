| 0-mul.c | **Task: 0. Infinite Multiplication** <br> A program written in C that multiplies two positive numbers. The usage is `mul num1 num2`, where `num1` and `num2` are passed in as base 10. They should only be composed of digits, if they aren't then `Error` is printed and the program exits with a status of `98`. It does this as well if the number of arguments is incorrect. Otherwise, the result is printed. |
