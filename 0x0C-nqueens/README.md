| 0-nqueens.py | **Task: 0. N queens** <br> A Python function, with the usage `nqueens N` in which `N` must be an integer greater or equal to `4`. If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments `Usage: nqueens N` is printed and the program is exited with the status `1`. If `N` is not an integer then `N must be a number` is printed but if `N` is less than `4` then `N must be at least 4` is printed and in both cases the program exits with the status `1`. This program prints every possible solution to the problem with one solutuion per line and without any particular order. Only the `sys` module was allowed to be imported. |
