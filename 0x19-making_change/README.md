| 0-making_change.py | **Task: 0. Change comes from within** <br> A function written in Python that determines the fewest number of coins needed to meet the given amount `total`. The prototype is `def makeChange(coins, total)`, which returns the fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`. If `total` can't be met by the number of coins owned, then `-1` is returned while `0` is returned if total equals `0` or less. The value of coin will always be an integer greater than `0` and it can be assumed there is an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list. |
