| 0-slide_line.c | **Task: 0. Slide line** <br> A C function, with the prototype of `int slide_line(int *line, size_t size, int direction);`, that slides and merges arrays of integers - similar to the 2048 game. `line` points to an array of integers containing `size` elements, that must be slided and merged to the direction represented by `direction`. The function returns `1` upon success or `0` upon failure. |
