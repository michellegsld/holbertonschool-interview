| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 0x00-lockboxes | **0x00. Lockboxes**<br>You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened. |
| 0x01-insert_in_sorted_linked_list | **0x01. Insert in sorted linked list** <br> Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. <ul><li>Prototype: `listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);`</li><li>Return: the address of the new node, or `NULL` if it failed</li></ul> |
| 0x02-heap_insert | **0x02. Heap Insert** <br> Write a function that creates a binary tree node. <ul><li>Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`</li><li>`parent` is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create</li><li>`value` is the value to put in the new node</li><li>When created, a node does not have any children</li><li>Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure</li></ul>Write a function that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap.<ul><li>Prototype: `heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **root, int value)`</li><li>`root` is a double pointer to the root node of the Heap</li><li>`value` is the value store in the node to be inserted</li><li>Your function must return a pointer to the inserted node, or `NULL` on failure</li><li>If the address stored in `root` is `NULL`, the created node must become the root node</li><li>You have to respect a `Max Heap` ordering</li><li>You are allowed to have up to `6` functions in your file</li></ul> |
